This is a typesafe [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and configured to serve a mulit-language website.

It consists of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Next SEO](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo#readme)
- [Next Sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap#readme)
- [Next i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next)

On the devâ€™s side of things it also benefits from:

- [Airbnb eslint config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

NextJS are rolling out new Router and Layout update so you may want to read their RFC (link in the description) for the alternative ways for doing things. This setup is based on the current documentation and is not using new or experimental features.

## Getting Started

Clone the project and install node modules:
```bash
npm install
```

Copy .env.sample file
```bash
cp .env.sample .env

```

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
